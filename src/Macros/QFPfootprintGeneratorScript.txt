Fixed a bug with the dialog entry.  Some numeric entries were
being multiplied by 10.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This script will generate QFP & TSOP footprints.

	Since most data sheets provide dimensions on QFPs from pin edge to
pin edge, this makes Protel's QFP IC wizard almost useless because:

1. Protel only deals with the center of the pins.

2. The center of the pad material under the pad is not a given measurement
   in the data sheets.

3. You may want a different amount of footprint land material going under the
   IC package VS excess material going outside the IC package.

4. Re-calculating the new virtual pad center while taking into account added
   material wanted for etch compensation increases the possibility of a mistake
   when using Protel's footprint wizard.


	If you don't believe the complexity of this endeavor, just take a look
at the math involved in my script just after the dialog entry, & before the for
loops.  This is all the work which Protel is missing in their footprint wizard.


How to use the entries:

1.  Enter the number of pins in the package vertically on one side.  Count only 1 side.
2.  Enter the width of the package from pin edge to pin edge on the left & right side
    of the package.
3.  Enter the +/- tolerance for the previous measurement.  Optional, I usually use 0


4.  Enter the number of pins horizontally in the package on one side.  Enter 0 her for
    TSOP package.
5.  Enter the vertical width of the package from pin edge to pin edge.

6.  Enter the pin spacing from pin to pin.
7.  Enter the pin width.
8.  Enter the pin length.

9.  Enter the extra-added plating material for the pin towards the inside of the IC
    package. 0 = no added material, 1 = 1 X the pin width added material. (Makes a
    perfect square and it's my personal recommendation).
10. Enter the extra-added plating material for the pin towards the outside of the IC
    package. 2 = 2 X the pin width.  (Makes a perfect 2X1 rectangle and it's my
    personal recommendation).
11. Enter additional etch compensation.  This adds additional meat to the pads
    horizontally & vertically.  I like 0.04mm. (about 1 mil)
12. Starting pin location.  0 = normal top left, 1 = old top middle.

13. Chose your measurement units, metric, or imperial.


Tadaa, you should have a perfect IC package.
